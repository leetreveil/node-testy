IDEAS: 

add aliases to common assert functions e.g. assert.strictEqual() becomes assert.se() etc
be able to name tests -  so we could say var mytest = new testy('buffer length test') and that would print the test name with the report
be able to set the timeout value for the test
be able to pass an options object? e.g. { name : 'mytest', timeout : 500, expected : 15 }
be able to manually invoke ranTests so it isn't a requirement that we use the custom assert object

should we disallow 'properties' and reccommend that expected/timeout settings are passed
through the constructor?
