IDEAS: 

be able to pass an options object? e.g. { name : 'mytest', timeout : 500, expected : 15 }
be able to manually invoke ranTests so it isn't a requirement that we use the custom assert object

should we disallow 'properties' and recommend that expected/timeout settings are passed
through the constructor?

MANTRA? everything is optional
